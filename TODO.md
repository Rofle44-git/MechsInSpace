# TODO

## Disclaimer
This is just a little personal checklist for me, WilliamTheMoth. __NOTHING__ listed here is guaranteed to be done.

In other words: __Don't__ expect me to *actually* do ***anything*** listed here.

## Game
- Weapon selector
- Deep red flash effect when player just got hit
- A game over screen
- A crosshair that jumps towards the closest with a tween

## Shop
- SOME GODDAMN BULLETS
- The shop itself obviously
- The ability to dodge attacks by quickly passing trough a horde of enemies

## Map
- Random map generator

## Settings
- Epilepsy safe(ish) `checkbutton`
- Effects/Particles `slider`
