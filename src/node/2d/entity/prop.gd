class_name Prop
extends Entity
## Class for interactable objects.
##
## A prop is an object that isn't actually sentient, but still reacts to
## events/interactions, or has complex scripted behavior. If an object is
## capable of freely interacting with other objects, or has some form of
## free-will/artificial-intelligence, then it is NOT a Prop (see
## [ConsciousEntity]).
##
## Examples: explosive barrel, destructable walls, crate, door
